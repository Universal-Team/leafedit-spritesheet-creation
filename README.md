These are the Spritesheet Creation Instructions for LeafEdit. [WIP]

## Requirements:

- Tex3ds.
- DevkitPro's DevkitARM.


## How to create Spritesheets:

You just need to modify the Images from `gfx/sprites/`.

After that, if you are on Windows, you can execute `compile.bat`. Otherwise execute `make` through a terminal. 

You will find `sprites.t3x` (The Spritesheet result) inside the `out` folder.

Create a Folder with a name you like and place `sprites.t3x` and `sheet.ini` inside it.

The Folder should be placed at `sdmc:/LeafEdit/SpriteSheets/`.

The `sheet.ini` File is placed at the `out` Folder, you can edit the Colors of it, if you like to have other Text Colors.
