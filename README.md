These are the Spritesheet Creation Instructions for LeafEdit. [WIP]

## Requirements:

- Tex3ds.
- DevkitPro's DevkitARM.


## How to create Spritesheets:

You just need to modify the Images from `gfx/sprites/`.

After that, if you are on Windows, you can execute `compile.bat`. Otherwise execute `make` through a terminal. 

You will find `sprites.t3x` (The Spritesheet result) inside the `out` folder.

When you're finished, place the newly created file onto your SD Card at `sdmc:/LeafEdit/SpriteSheets/`.
